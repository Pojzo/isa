    ./src
        tftp_client.c
        tftp_server.c
        args_parser.c
        config.c
        utils.c

    ./include
        args.h
        utils.h
        config.h

Compile with:
    make

Run with:
    ./bin/tftp-client -h hostname [-p port] [-f filepath] -t dest_filepath
    ./bin/tftp-server [-p port]

What works: Downloading and uploading without options. Downloading from server with blksize option. 
            The server can accept timeout option but its functionality is not implemented. Octet and netascii mode in
            download.

What does not work: Most error handling is not implemented. Timeout option. Netascii mode in upload. The server is not
concurrent - only one client can communicate at given time.
